Bliss
=====

Bliss application engine is an open-source collaborative web application engine. It aims to provide all the building blocks of a fully built web application for rapid development.

Modular
-------
Bliss is built using flexible modules that can be used throughout the application for many different purposes.  Every module is aimed to be loosely coupled with all other modules.

Data Driven
-----------
Bliss has been built from the ground up as a RESTful web application.  All data is passed via JSON requests to and from the server.  The front end has been designed to use the powerful AngularJS framework and to be as modular as the back end.
