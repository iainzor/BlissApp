Bliss Application Setup
=======================
This is a basic setup procedure to get you going with the Bliss Application Engine

* Import the db.sql into your local MySQL instance
    * The imported data will allow you to sign in using the credentials: admin/admin
* Depending on where the application is installed, you will need to provide a **development.php** or **production.php** configuration file under **/path/to/app/private/config/**.  A sample config is provided to get you started.  You will only need to copy it to the specified directory and provide the local database credentials.
